# Group_Assignment
Group members: Sofie, Maria, Jeppe og Esben

We have chosen to work with PGA_Data: A historical dataset, which contains data from the PGA tour from 2010 to august 2018. We have chosen this dataset because we believe, we can find some interesting patterns between some features (independent variables) and how much money the Golf players earns. We will elaborate on the chosen variables later in the assignment, after taking a look at the data.  

**Problem statement:** 
*Does the golf player's skills have influence on how much money they earn?*


To answer the above problem statement, we have chosen six different abilities, which we believe have an influence on the income of the golf players. 

In this assignment, we will use Machine Learning techniques to analyse and find patterns in the dataset, but also predict how many money some random players earns. We will use the two branches of Machine Learning; Unsupervised and Supervised Learning, which will be further elaborated later in this assignment.
